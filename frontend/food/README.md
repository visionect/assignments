## Food search

Create a web app for users to search recipes by name and show results in a list. Every recipe that is found should have a clickable link besides the name and when the user clicks on a link, the recipe information is shown. You can limit the search results to 10 recipes.

The interface must contain a search input box, a "Search" button and a list of search results. If the focus is on the search box and ENTER was pressed by the user, then recipe search must be triggered.

For searching through the recipes, use the spoonacular API, found at https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

The visual look of the app must be clean and is up to the developer.

You can choose your tech stack (angular/vue/react), but we prefer react.

## Extra

Not necessary but appreciated:

1. the web app shows a list of recently searched recipes and save the list to local storage and retrieve it again when the web app reloads,
2. user can star the recipe. The star is saved and later restored from local storage and shown below the recipe search box.

### Submission

The final solution should be submitted in a form of a git repository or a compressed archive to your recruiter. The final solution must also contain clear instructions how to compile the webapp, any extras (e.g. code comments) are appretiated.
