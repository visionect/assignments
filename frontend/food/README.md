## Food search

Create a web app for users to search recipes by name and show results in a list. Every recipe that is found should have a clickable link besides the name and when the user clicks on a link, the recipe information is shown. You can limit the search results to 10 recipes.

For searching through the recipes, use the spoonacular API, found at https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

The visual look of the app must be clean and is up to the developer.

You can choose your tech stack (angular/vue/react), but we prefer react.

### Submission

The final solution should be submitted in a form of a git repository or a compressed archive to your recruiter. The final solution must also contain clear instructions how to compile the webapp, any extras (e.g. code comments) are appretiated.
