## Assignment for the Junior Frontend Engineer position

Create a simple TODO web app where the user can add new items to a TODO list or remove items from the list by clicking on the item checkbox.

Acceptance Criteria:
- item is instantly added to the TODO list by hitting the ENTER key,
- item is instantly removed from the TODO list by checking the box besides the item,
- the TODO list is always visible to the user
- the TODO list is modified instantly on user action (adding or removing items)

The visual look of the app must be clean and is up to the developer.

You can choose your tech stack (angular/vue/react), but we prefer react.

### Submission

The final solution should be submitted in a form of a git repository or a compressed archive to your recruiter. The final solution must also contain clear instructions how to compile the webapp, any extras (e.g. code comments) are appretiated.
